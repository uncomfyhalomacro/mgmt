# 📅 Appointment & Queue Management System

A full-stack appointment scheduling and queue management system built with **FastAPI**, designed for small to medium service-based businesses (e.g. clinics, salons, consultation services).

This system allows customers to book appointments, staff to manage queues, and admins to oversee operations through a centralized dashboard.

## Initial setup

Requires [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [nix](https://nixos.org).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/direnv
# Either copy or append the layout script
cat $PROJECT_PATH/.direnv.uv >> ~/.config/direnv/direnvrc
direnv allow
```

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

### Structured Business Logic
- Core logic separated into `services/`
- Routes remain thin and declarative

### Conflict Prevention
- Booking logic ensures:
  - no overlapping appointments
  - valid time slots only

### State Machine for Appointments
Each appointment follows a strict lifecycle:

```
scheduled → checked_in → in_progress → completed
                         ↘ no_show
scheduled → cancelled
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest
```

Includes:
- booking conflict tests
- auth tests
- role permission tests

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Payment integration (Stripe)
- SMS/email reminders
- Google Calendar sync
- Multi-branch support
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- Public booking page

---
